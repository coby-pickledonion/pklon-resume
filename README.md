## My Resume
Hi! Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Despite the controversial opinion that LaTeX is outdated, I value its flexibility and have chosen to use it for crafting my resume. In this repository, you'll find the LaTeX code for my resume, showcasing my experience and skills as a frontend engineer.
